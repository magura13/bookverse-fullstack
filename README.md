# BookVerse 

It's a project build in Node and React with Javascript. The project runs in node 18+.

The main objective of the project is to learn more about programming logic and to become a fullStack developer.

I'm using layered architeture and MVC. At the moment the project is not connected to any database, so i'm not create the models yet.
